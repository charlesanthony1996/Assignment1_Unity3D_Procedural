### About the project


### Get started


### Usage

### 1.Assignment 1 Unity 3D - Procedural

* Five objects are created procedurally

* Two of the concave objects were made in blender and can be switched it by uncommenting the code.
 
* The two child objects rotate around the two parent objects. their speeds will be adjusted from the UI's.

* Shooter object is created not through the script.

* raycasting is implemented with the line renderer component. delays are added and the game object is destroyed after two seconds.

* the shooter object to move in an elliptical path. the path can be adjusted in the x, y or z axes from the code.(3D path) the script responsible for it is the raycast script.currently it moves in 2D fashion.

* Remember the 3D bezier curve is not constrained to a plane.(may seem like 2D)

* Some objects are made from the unity editor itself, and some are produced procedurally,to run the project, press the play button





### Roadmap

* Roadmap is being explained in the usage part

* The concave objects were difficult to make procedurally so blender was used to create them and were exported as FBX files.

* the problem of destorying the line renderer object can be better, but i wasnt able to understand it properly within the time frame.

* Concave objects creation through procedural scripting has to be learned and implemented.

* The objects were made in the editor are the wall1, wall2, wall3, wall4, the Shooter object, the floor the four waypoints the 3D bezier curve is constrained to(point0, point1, point2, point3). The bezierPathTestObject is made to test the curve.

* The rest of the objects are produced procedurally (The five objects)
